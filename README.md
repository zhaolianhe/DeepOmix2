# DeepOmix2


### Description

### 

*In this work we propose to use omics and pathology images to build a clinical intepratation model for various tasks including survival analyisis， therapy responses，staging prediction and metastatic state. We present DeepOmix with a pretrained pathology model for pan-cancer and a widely application on various cancer types. Our model is tested on an held-out set and an external set of 789 WSIs from three institutions. *
